### Additional Coding Preferences

- Log updated files (filenames) in log.md - include date time (Y-m-d H:i 24 hour clock)
- Avoid building the application unless I request it.
- Android SDK Command-Line Tools (commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest) is used to build the applications - not Android Studio, so imports will need adding for any code requiring them.
